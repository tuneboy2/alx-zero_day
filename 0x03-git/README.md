# **Git**
In this project, we were introduced to Git, GitHub and Source code management. I learnt basic commands like `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` amidst others.
## **Tasks**

- **0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**
  - The following steps were followed to successfully create and setup my account.
    - Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]
    - Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github
    - Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet
    - Step 3 - Create your first repository 
    - Step 4 - Open the sandbox/terminal
    - Step 5 - Clone your repository
    - Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications
    
- **1. Repo-session**
  - A new directory called [0x03-git](../0x03-git) in your alx-zero_day repo.
  
 - **2. Coding fury road**
   - These directories were created: `bash`, `c`, `js`
   - Empty files were created thus: `c/c_is_fun.c`, `js/main.js`, and `js/index.js`
   - A file `bash/alx` and `bash/school` was created.

- **3. Collaboration is the base of a company**
  - A branch `update_script` is created, and its contents were updated.

- **4. Collaboration: be up to date**
  - The README.md file was updated via the main branch from GitHub.com.
  - Get all changes of the main branch locally via `git pull`
  - Create a new file `up_to_date` at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
  - Add `up_to_date`to git
  
  - **5. HAAA what did you do???**
   - The branch `update_script` to main and all conflicts were resolved
  
- **6. Never push too much**
  - [.gitignore](./.gitignore): A `.gitignore` file that defines a rule to never push `~` files
